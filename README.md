<summary>What is Bingo?</summary>
<br>
    A game which dates back to 1530 in Italy, the standardised version dates back to 1920's America.

    In the United States, Bingo is a game of chance in which each player matches numbers printed in different arrangements on cards which the numbers the game host (caller) draws at random, marking the selected numbers with tiles. When a player finds the selected numbers are arranged on their card in a row, they call out "Bingo!" to alert all participants to a winning card, which prompts the game host (or an associate assisting the host) to examine the card for verification of the win. Players compete against one another to be the first to have a winning arrangement for the prize or jackpot. After a winner is declared, the players clear their number cards of the tiles and the game host begins a new round of play.

    [Bingo (American version)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bingo_(American_version))

    > Bingo is often used as an instructional tool in American schools and in teaching English as a foreign language in many countries. Typically, the numbers are replaced with beginning reader words, pictures, or unsolved math problems. Custom bingo creation programs now allow teachers and parents to create bingo cards using their own content.

    Bingo as a teaching tool.

    ![Catalog%20Of%20Archival%20Resilence/Screen_Shot_2020-03-02_at_11.40.33.png](Catalog%20Of%20Archival%20Resilence/Screen_Shot_2020-03-02_at_11.40.33.png)

    > In the US, the game is primarily staged by churches or charity organizations. Their legality and stakes vary by state regulation. In some states, bingo halls are rented out to sponsoring organizations, and such halls often run games almost every day. Church-run games, however, are normally weekly affairs held on the church premises. These games are usually played for modest stakes, although the final game of a session is frequently a coverall game that offers a larger jackpot prize for winning within a certain quantity of numbers called, and a progressive jackpot is one that may increase per session until it is won.

    Connection to International Organisation of Good Templars, which can be compared to a church or charity organisation, they could use it to get some extra income for the organisation.

    > Bingo has gone beyond a fundraising role and is often featured in bars and nightclubs as a social and entertainment event, attracting a loyal following of regular players. Many venues promote a bingo event to attract customers at off-peak times, such as weeknights and Sundays, which are traditionally slower for such businesses. The games are called by drag and non-drag hosts alike and often include ancillary activities such as cabaret shows, contests and other themed activities that add interest and encourage audience participation. Customers are invited to play for a chance to win cash and other prizes.

    Therefor this game can organise a sense of unity and community between followers of the IOoGT. A method of bonding.

    ## Kienspel(Dutch)

    My own view on Bingo: in Dutch culture it is mainly used as a game to socialise and entertain elderly people, you often see Bingo nights in care houses.

    ## What is the purpose of this game and why would the "International Organisation of Good Templars" make use of it?

    There are multiple purposes of Bingo, but my guess at the purpose of Bingo within the IOoGT is to create a cash flow income to help them spread their message in a better way. Also to create a community, a reason to get together to form a group, so a method of bonding between ints followers.

Games as a tool for recruiting for the army and spreading negative message about other nationalities.

> America’s Army was released by the US Army on 4 July 2002 and, up until now, 41 versions of the game have been released in total, all financed by the US government and available for free download. The game is a recruitment tool, and each version has two parts: Operations, in which the player battles opponents in a first-person shooter mode, and Soldiers, in which the player advances up the various ranks.

<summary>Cold War</summary>
<br>
The Cold War was a period of geopolitical tension between the Soviet Union and the United States and their respective allies, the Eastern Bloc and the Western Bloc, after World War II. The period is generally considered to span the 1947 Truman Doctrine to the 1991 dissolution of the Soviet Union. The term "cold" is used because there was no large-scale fighting directly between the two superpowers, but they each supported major regional conflicts known as proxy wars. The conflict was based around the ideological and geopolitical struggle for global influence by the two powers, following their temporary alliance and victory against Nazi Germany in 1945. The doctrine of mutually assured destruction (MAD) discouraged a pre-emptive attack by either side. Aside from the nuclear arsenal development and conventional military deployment, the struggle for dominance was expressed via indirect means such as psychological warfare, propaganda campaigns, espionage, far-reaching embargoes, rivalry at sports events and technological competitions such as the Space Race.<br><br>

*So I have a good amount of entry points to make transcodings about: Western vs Eastern block, proxy wars, temporary alliance, Nuclear Arms Race(Coding direction), Military deployment, struggle of dominance, psychological warfare, propaganda campaigns, espionage and Space Race, to name a few.*

*Some bystanders have heard of it, as far as the receptionist knew nobody knew where it came from.*

Why does the archive have this collection?

*Not a specific answer, could be added with other collections.*

*Ik vermoed daarom dat veel hiervan direct aan het IISG is overgedragen, misschien door een loge, of door individuele leden. Sommigen van de vele speldjes kunnen ons ook nog langs een andere weg bereikt hebben, bijvoorbeeld via het persoonsarchief van iemand die toevallig lid was, of als losse schenking. Om privacyredenen vermelden we dit vaak niet. — IISG*

Why does this needs to be archived?

*No clear answer, something along the lines of it being an old organisation, which had an impact/mission in the history.*

Framing a position towards it.

Strip away the meaning of the organisation —> Abstraction

Why do I want to make it resilience?

What is the relevance of this topic against other topics? Or is it in the object itself?

Look at the Metadata.

What is the social context, which is not in the archive, related to the city, how does it look like back then?

What kind of game is it?

Commercial, propaganda

[Arbeiders Jeugd Centrale](https://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arbeiders_Jeugd_Centrale)

- Description

    Opgericht in maart 1918 stelde de Arbeiders Jeugd Centrale (AJC) zich ten doel jongeren uit de arbeidersklasse op te voeden en te ontwikkelen en hen voor te bereiden op deelname aan de strijd van de arbeidersbeweging voor het socialisme; de AJC functioneerde aanvankelijk als jeugdorganisatie van het Nederlands Verbond van Vakverenigingen en de Sociaal-Democratische Arbeiders Partij (SDAP); in 1920 werd Koos Vorrink bezoldigd secretaris-redacteur en in 1924 voorzitter van de AJC; onder zijn leiding groeide de AJC uit tot een krachtige jeugdorganisatie, die een eigen stijl had: geen alcohol en tabak, een eigen manier van kleden, feestvieren en vrijetijdsbesteding; wandelen en kamperen hoorden daarbij en zingen, volksdansen, muziek en lekenspel; na de Duitse inval in mei 1940 besloot het hoofdbestuur in augustus 1940 de AJC op te heffen; ondergronds werden bepaalde activiteiten voortgezet; na de bevrijding werd de AJC spoedig heropgericht; in de loop van de jaren vijftig zorgden de emancipatie van de arbeidersklasse en de ontzuiling er voor dat de traditionele AJC-stijl de jeugd minder aansprak; in februari 1959 werd de AJC opgeheven; in maart 1959 werd het Jeugd- en Jongerencentrum 'Ruimte' opgericht; in 1980 werd de Stichting Onderzoek AJC opgericht die zich ten doel stelde materiaal betreffende de AJC te verzamelen en onderzoek naar de geschiedenis te verrichten; eind 2002 achtte de Stichting haar taken voltooid en besloot deze zich op te heffen.
